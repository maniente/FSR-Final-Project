The project focuses on the modeling and control of a snake robot, implemented and simulated using MATLAB and Simulink. The choice of this topic stems from the unique characteristics and versatility of snake robots, which make them both scientifically intriguing . Snake robots are a class of bio-inspired systems that exhibit highly flexible and adaptive locomotion. They can be considered both as terrestrial robots and as underwater vehicles (UUVs), depending on their intended application. This duality enhances their appeal and positions them as valuable tools in diverse environments, from navigating narrow pipelines to exploring terrains. What makes snake robots particularly fascinating is their distinct mode of locomotion.As mentioned during a lecture in the course, they exploit body undulations and surface friction to move a mechanism that sets them apart. In this sense, their behavior shares conceptual similarities with unicycle robots in terms of underactuation and control challenges, and with legged robots in how friction is harnessed for propulsion. Motivated by these considerations, we explored current techniques for modeling and controlling snake-like robots. Our goal was to apply and extend the theoretical background acquired in the
course, particularly concerning the study of underactuated and redundant systems.
